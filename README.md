# tic-tac-toe
Building a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch. Planning on diving into socket.io and try to implement like a matchmaking system as the users should be able to play against each other.

Client-folder: The React-application which will contain the actual game and it's logic
Server-folder (not created yet): Probably an express-application to serve socket.io
